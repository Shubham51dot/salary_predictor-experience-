# Simple Linear Regression

### Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:

1. One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
2. The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.
